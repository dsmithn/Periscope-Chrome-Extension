Periscope Extension for Google Chrome

This extenstion is a replacement for the built in Find function in Chrome. It offers two unique features, however. Your searches remain saved on the browser to be applied on every page that is loaded. Also, you can restrict the search to be applied only on specific websites by including a matching URL in the "Website Match" field.
